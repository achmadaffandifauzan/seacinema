The SEA Cinema Movie Ticket Booking App is a web application built using Node.js with Express.js framework for the server-side and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client-side. It utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing movie information, user details, and ticket transactions. The app allows users to browse through a collection of movies, book tickets, view their ticket transaction history, and manage their user balance.

The project aims to improve the moviegoing experience by providing a convenient and user-friendly platform for customers to book movie tickets. With the SEA Cinema Movie Ticket Booking App, users can easily browse available movies, choose seats, and secure their reservations within seconds. The integration of a user balance feature eliminates the need for cash transactions, adding to the overall convenience for customers.
